<p>Efforts towards quantifying the diversity in various industries have gained a great deal of attention in the last few years. From the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, to the initiatives towards transparency in Silicon Valley, to the recent benchmark survey in publishing, quantifying diversity has become a central component of highlighting areas in the workforce that are notably homogenous in order to approach diversity initiatives strategically.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2015, as a part of Ithaka S+R, I administered a survey to over 1,000 cultural organizations in New York City who receive funds from the Department of Cultural Affairs in order to generate a benchmark demographic analysis of the cultural sector. The survey intended to measure the diversity of these organizationsâ€™ staff and board members. Eighty-seven percent of these organizations turned in spreadsheets with anonymized records for each employee and board member. In all, the spreadsheets yielded a dataset with 48,000 records.</p>

<p>In the above visualization we can see a scatter plot of responding cultural organizations. Each circle represents a single organization. They are plotted on the x axis by the percentage of white staff members and on the y axis by the percentage of female staff members (In aggregate these were the observations with the highest frequency for the race and gender variables). Organizations are color coded by budget. Budget categories include $0-250,000, $250,000-1 million, $1 million - 5 million, $5 million - 10 million and +$10 million. You can add and remove budget categories by selecting from the legend on the right. Notice that there is a relatively even distribution by gender (52% female, 48% male). However, racially, the arts sector in New York is primarily white, 62%. While gender maps closely to New York's residential community, racially arts staff are more homogenous than the city population, which is only 33% white.</p>

<p>The above graph shows two bar charts. On the top we see the total number of staff in each discipline (as defined by DCLA). On the bottom we see the percentage of white staff in that discipline. The categories are organized in ascending order of percent white staff. We will take a closer look at three disciplines: Music, Theater and Dance. </p>

<p>The above visualization is similar to the first one we explored. Organizations are plotted according to the percentage of white staff and percentage of female staff. Here we are looking only at the disciplines dance, theater and music. Notice that dance organizations are distributed more evenly across the plot, while theater and music organizations are shifted to the right. On average dance organizations are 55% white while music and theater are 68% and 70%, respectively. </p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p> The above graph shows positions in the music sector that are over 75% white. As we can see the most significant of these position is Technical/Production staff, which is nearly four times as large as the next largest of these positions.</p>

<h2>Theater</h2>

<p>Similarly in theater we see that of the positions over 3/4 white, Technical/Production staff are the largest category. Since the DCLA report has come out, the Theater Subdistrict Council has allocated $2 million in grants for organizations who diversify their technical/production staff: <a href="http://www.americantheatre.org/2016/03/17/nyc-announces-new-diversity-grant-program-for-theatres/">NYC Announces New Diversity Grant Progam for Theatres</p>

<h2>Dance</h2>

<p>Among dance organizations, positions are much more diverse. There are only two categories over 3/4 white. The above graph expands to show organizations that are more than 50% white.

Working with the city on this project has revealed to me how powerful data driven findings can be in promoting change. After seeing the DCLA report, the Mertz Gilmore foundation commissioned a similar project specifically for dance. I recently heard Oskar Eustis of The Public Theater speak at Macaulay Honors College and share that in light of the DCLA report they have committed to pay their interns and to diversify their board to 50% POC. If these efforts to diversify are successful we can hope to have a staff in the cultural sector that better represents the population it serves, and brings more perspectives to programming in the arts.
